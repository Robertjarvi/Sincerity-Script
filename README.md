# Sincerity Scoring Script
**Author**: Romain  
**License**: MIT License  

## Overview
This script is a powerful tool designed to evaluate the sincerity of messages, filtering serious proposals for visionaries like Elon Musk and teams like xAI. Built from scratch by a solo innovator, it aligns with the mission to "accelerate human scientific discovery" by prioritizing innovation, discovery, and genuine intent.

This is just one piece of a broader vision – a project blending cutting-edge AI and strategic insights for Tesla. Want to know more? Contact me.

## Features
- **Clarity Scoring**: Measures how specific and actionable a message is.  
- **Alignment Scoring**: Ensures proposals match ambitious goals (e.g., AI breakthroughs, brain-computer interfaces, space exploration).  
- **Scam Detection**: Filters out noise and suspicious content.  
- **Kalman Filter**: Smooths scores for reliable results.  
- **Innovation Trend**: Tracks sincerity over time to spot rising potential.  
- **Scalable**: Optimized for production use (e.g., AWS Lambda).  

## Why This Matters
I’m Romain, a former tree trimmer turned tech dreamer, with a past in sales at Samsung (launching 4K TVs). I’ve poured 2 months at 20 hours/day into ideas that push boundaries – this script is one of them. It’s built to save time, spotlight real innovators, and keep the focus on advancing humanity. Test it – it’ll score me >80.

## Installation
### Option 1: One-command setup
Run this script to install everything and launch:  
```bash
bash install.sh
```

## Installation
## Option 2: Manual setup
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Install dependencies:

```bash

pip install nltk sentence-transformers numpy scikit-learn
```

Usage
Evaluate messages with a single run. Example:

```python

from sincerity_score import process_message_batch

messages = [
    "I’m Romain, solo dev. My AI system boosts Grok and Neuralink. Let’s collab!",
    "Hey bro, send money quick for a secret deal."
]
results = process_message_batch(messages)

for result in results:
    print(f"Message {result['message_id']+1}:")
    print(f"Score: {result['score']:.2f}/100")
    print(f"Recommendation: {result['recommendation']}")
    print(f"Innovation Trend: {result['innovation_trend']}")
```

Output example:
```
Message 1:
Score: 85.23/100
Recommendation: Remonter
Innovation Trend: Stable
```

```
Message 2:
Score: 32.45/100
Recommendation: Ignorer
Innovation Trend: Stable
```

Part of Something Bigger
This script is a teaser – a taste of my work. I’ve got a full system (v3 IA) that redefines AI memory, plus a strategy to boost Tesla’s presence in PACA, France. It’s all about dreaming big and making it real. Interested? Let’s talk: consulting@web3-crypto.xyz
