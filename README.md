# Sincerity Scoring Script
**Author**: Romain  
**License**: MIT License  

## Overview
A powerful tool to evaluate message sincerity, filtering serious proposals for visionaries like Elon Musk and xAI. Built by a solo innovator, it aligns with the mission to "accelerate human scientific discovery," spotlighting innovation and genuine intent.

This is a glimpse of a bigger vision – a groundbreaking AI system and Tesla strategy. Curious? Let’s talk.

## Features
- **Clarity Scoring**: Gauges specificity and actionability.  
- **Alignment Scoring**: Matches ambitious goals (AI breakthroughs, brain-computer interfaces, space exploration).  
- **Scam Detection**: Cuts through noise and scams.  
- **Kalman Filter**: Smooths scores for accuracy.  
- **Innovation Trend**: Tracks potential over time.  
- **Scalable**: Ready for production (e.g., AWS Lambda).  

## Why This Matters
I’m Romain – ex-tree trimmer, ex-Samsung (launched 4K TVs), now a tech dreamer. I’ve poured 2 months at 20 hours/day into boundary-pushing ideas. This script saves time, highlights innovators, and keeps humanity first. Test it – I score >80.

## Installation
### Option 1: One-Command Setup
Install and run with a single line:  
```bash
bash install.sh
```

Option 2: Manual Setup

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
Evaluate messages with ease. Example:

python
```
from sincerity_score import process_message_batch

messages = [
    "I’m Romain, solo dev. My AI boosts Grok and Neuralink. Collab?",
    "Hey bro, send cash for a quick deal."
]
results = process_message_batch(messages)

for result in results:
    print(f"Message {result['message_id']+1}:")
    print(f"Score: {result['score']:.2f}/100")
    print(f"Recommendation: {result['recommendation']}")
    print(f"Innovation Trend: {result['innovation_trend']}")

```
Sample Output:
```
Message 1:
Score: 85.23/100
Recommendation: Remonter
Innovation Trend: Stable

Message 2:
Score: 32.45/100
Recommendation: Ignorer
Innovation Trend: Stable
```

Part of a Bigger Vision
This script is a teaser. My v3 IA redefines AI memory (no tokens!), and my Tesla PACA strategy boosts sales in France’s top spots (ex. Fnac Nice, Carrefour Aix). It’s bold, it’s real, and it’s for humanity. Want in? Contact me: consulting@web3-crypto.xyz
